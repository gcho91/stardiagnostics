        <h1>What are Electro-diagnostic tests?</h1>
        <!-- <p>sjdfadsjkfhdsjkhfajksdhf djsfahsdjfhdsjfhd jhafdjfhajhfds</p> -->
        <p>Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are performed to assess the functioning of nerves and to identify disease in the peripheral nervous systems. Testing measures the speed, size and scope of a response transmitted through a nerve when prompted by an electrical stimulus. NCS typically involves the application of surface electrodes to the skin and may also require needle electrodes. To perform NCS, an electrical stimulus is applied via an electrode and the response is recorded via other electrodes placed over appropriate nerves and/or muscles. Test results may be useful in the diagnosis or the development of a proper treatment plan.</p>
